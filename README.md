# blog-RESTful-APIs
This project is a RESTful API built using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose for MongoDB. It provides endpoints for managing [users, file, post] with full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The API is designed to support JSON requests/responses and integrating with a MongoDB database for persistent storage.
